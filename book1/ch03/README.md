## Task 1

Original exercise number: 1

> Create an empty array which can contain ten integers.
> - Fill that array with numbers 10, 20, …​, 100. (Hint: use loops)
> - Print only the elements of that array that are on odd indices (values 20, 40, …​).
> - Multiply elements on even indices by 5. Print the modified array.

## Task 2

Original exercise number: 2

> Re-do the Collatz conjecture exercise, but this time instead of printing each step, add it to a sequence.
> - Pick a starting number. Interesting choices, among others, are 9, 19, 25 and 27.
> - Create a sequence whose only member is that starting number
> - Using the same logic as before, keep adding elements to the sequence until you reach 1
> - Print the length of the sequence, and the sequence itself

## Task 1

Original exercise number: 1

> [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a
> popular mathematical problem with simple rules. First pick a number. If it is
> odd, multiply it by three and add one; if it is even, divide it by two. Repeat
> this procedure until you arrive at one. E.g. 5 → odd → 3*5 + 1 = 16 → even →
> 16 / 2 = 8 → even → 4 → 2 → 1 → end!  Pick an integer (as a mutable variable)
> and create a loop which will print every step of the Collatz conjecture.
> (Hint: use div for division)

## Task 2

Original exercise number: 4

> [...] you have converted inches to centimeters, and vice versa. Create a
> conversion table with multiple values.

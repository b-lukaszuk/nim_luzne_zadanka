[Exercises](https://narimiran.github.io/nim-basics/#_exercises_4)

## Task 1

Original exercise number: 3

> Points in 2D plane can be represented as `tuple[x, y: float]`. Write a
> procedure which will receive two points and return a new point which is a sum
> of those two points (add x’s and y’s separately).

## Task 2

Original exercise number: 4

Create two procedures `tick` and `tock` which echo out the words "tick" and
"tock". Have a global variable to keep track of how many times they have run,
and run one from the other until the counter reaches 20. The expected output is
to get lines with "tick" and "tock" alternating 20 times. (Hint: use forward
declarations.)
